# craigslist-cars-analysis
Craigslist has become one the worldâ€™s largest collection of used cars for sale. This dataset was containing
over 10,000 vehicles and 25 columns that were scraped from the Craigslist website. I am going to
conduct a data analysis in Python on this dataset with the goal of building a model to predict the prices
of these vehicles.
